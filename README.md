# Clockknight-Projects
 Collection of projects I personally use to automate things I do.

 Explanation of each project underneath:

 ALBUM DOWNLOADER

 COMIC SCANNER

 DAILY COUNTDOWN TIMER
 Daily Countdown Timer is intended to specifically work with the Rainmeter extension "Magnumizer's Countdown Timer", that will update the date to today, leaving the time untouched.
 This program will prompt for a location of the timer settings, if it doesn't already have a location saved. It'll save it by putting it to a .txt file in the same directory as the script.

 The script works as intended, but putting the script in the startup folder doesn't work as intended.

 FILE RAISER
 File Raiser will scan a given directory for any subdirectories, and any files inside of those subdirectories, moving them up to the initial directory.
Delete Mode(-d):
 The program only copies the files by default, but the argument -d can be passed through, to activate DELETE MODE (also known as moving the files instead).
Unsafe Mode(-u):
 The program usually confirms that the files should be raised, but passing the argument -u in console will skip the prompt and immediately attempt to raise any files found.

 TWITTER GRABBER
 Twitter Grabber is intended to search through a given twitter account's following page and find the media pages of those accounts, and save them onto a text file. It's intended to be used with the jDownloader2 program to download the files on those media pages.
