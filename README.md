 DAILY COUNTDOWN TIMER
 INCOMPLETE
 Daily Countdown Timer (DCT) is intended to specifically work with the Rainmeter extension "Magnumizer's Countdown Timer", that will update the date to today, leaving the time untouched.
 This program will prompt for a location of the timer settings, if it doesn't already have a location saved. It'll save it by putting it to a txt file in the same directory as the script.

 FILE RAISER
 INCOMPLETE
 File Raiser will scan a given directory for any subdirectories, and any files inside of those subdirectories, moving them up to the initial directory.
 The program only copies the files by default, so you can confirm details about the files, but the argument -d can be passed through, to activate DELETE MODE (also known as moving the files instead).
